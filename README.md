# Solidify
Small GUI utility on top of OpenImageIO and QT5 to Solidify (fill, push-pull) empty areas in textures.
Can be used to Normalize normal maps and export alpha/mask channels as single-channel Grayscale images.
Possible to use to unpack/repair the third channel for packed two-channel tangent space normals.

Usage
------------
On start, set desired app settings would be used in the current batch.

Run Solidify.exe and drag and drop images into the open window.
Check the console for progress information.

Tool expecting RGBA or Grayscale with the alpha channel image file. Output files will be written in the same folder as source files with the name **Source_file_name_fill.ext** as RGB without an alpha channel.

From v1.2 possible to use the external alpha channel as a single channel file with **_mask.ext** or **_alpha.ext** in name (case insencitive).

Supporting for RGB and Grayscale images only with external alpha/mask image files.

To optimize performance Solidify app reads external alpha channel file once per batch.
